          Hi, my name is Youssef.
During university, I had internships in the data field. I enjoyed what I did, but it didn't feel right for me. Eventually, I began to study the data analysis track after I heard my brother and I met Data Analysts and scientists talk about it . Finding out what they did changed the trajectory of my career. 
          </Typography>
          <Typography>
           They built reports and dashboards which amazed me. They used modern tools and How they trained machines how to mimic human beings. I love all that and I want to make similar. learned how much a career in data could earn was the icing on the cake. I was hooked. I began relentlessly studying Excel, SQL, Tableau, Power BI, etc.
A few months later, I landed my first role as a freelance data analyst.
